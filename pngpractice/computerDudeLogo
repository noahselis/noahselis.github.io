/* We used the svg logo creator here: https://svgedit.netlify.app/editor/index.html#paste to make a stupid logo and I hate their setup there has to be a better way.
   I feel like it was just the free option and in a professional environment we'd use something like adobe illustrator like Kelsey uses.
